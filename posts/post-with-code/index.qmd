# The View from Here

##   Responsibility

Data points plotted

Reducing people to stats

*Controlling the view*

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
 starwars %>%
 filter(sex == "male") %>%
   filter (skin_color == "light")
``` 

##   Neglect
  
*Footnote   Unviewed   Passed*

Critical    Unimportant

Struggling to be seen 



```{r}
ggplot (starwars, aes(x=height, y=mass, color=eye_color))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "What Should I Be Seeing Here?")
```

##    Sacred Trust
  
Tossed   Teased   Tried   Tempted

Data unfurls slow slowly

*View what you have wrought*
